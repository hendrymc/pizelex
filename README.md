# pizelex
This is a responsive framework SASS/CSS

Is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

I used to use Bootstrap grid responsive, but I see that have something very uncomfortable, with many classes, properties and queries, that most websites are not needed, for this reason I made "pizelex" responsive web design with "SASS" CSS extension language.

The classes blocks are similar just that with a CSS file lighter and a  file SASS easier of modify ;)
